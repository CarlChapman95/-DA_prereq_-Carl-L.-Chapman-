    "Hey there! I'm Carl. Excited to get through the Data Analyst pathway after doing the Web Dev path last semester. I was super torn between the 2 options but now I'll have both. Learned a lot about what I need to put in from the first and more motivated to push myself on this class. I would say my interests are video games, but honestly now adays they aren't as fun as getting outside with friends and just honestly self improvement stuff. Turning 30 has put life into prospective and it's time to buckle down and do something actually meaningful for my 7 year old and myself!\n",
